Welcome.
Answers to the requested questions.

1. I currently use react navigation, which is recommended in the react native documentation.
2. I use redux with redux thunk(asynchronous) to work with the data and save it on redux, as well to save it in async storage(persist).
3. In general I don't use any UI frameworks, but in this project I have used react-native-paper, from where I used only modal.
